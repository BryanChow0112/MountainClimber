## Features

* Linked Structures: Dynamic sequences of climbs managed through linked lists, allowing fast insertions and deletions.
* Hash Tables: Quick storage and retrieval of climber data with custom hash functions and collision handling.
* Recursive Sorting: Efficient organization of climb data using merge sort and quicksort.
* Recursive Game Logic: Recursive methods for smooth player interaction and movement.


## Getting Started

* Get a virtual environment up and running
* `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (Replacing python with python3 or py - whatever works)

## Running the GUI

`python main.py`

## Running the Tests

`python run_tests.py`

## Running just some of the Tests

`python run_tests.py 1` will run all tests marked with `@number("1.x")`.
